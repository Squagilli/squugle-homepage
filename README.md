This project is an attempt to solidfy my knowledge of HTML and CSS
by using developer tools to clone google's homepage. 

As for functionality, it should be completely useless.

However, my main is to create a beautiful clone - artfully and pain-stakingly
designed to showcase my natural CSS talent. 

Thanks for looking a this.
